I couldnâ€™t find much online about sending multiple values from Unreal Engine to Arduino, so I wanted to share this method here. The code is adapted from TouchDesigner documentation: https://docs.derivative.ca/Arduino.

I'm using this with two servos, but it can work with multiple components as long as you update the code accordingly.

On the Unreal Engine side, the image below shows how I'm sending the 2 values to the Arduino.
